# Optimizing-Agriculture



## Overview

This project focuses on wheat crop tracking using digital image analysis. The system utilizes the stb_image library in C and employs sophisticated algorithms for image processing, including resizing, cropping, and pixel analysis. The goal is to provide a robust solution for real-time monitoring and analysis of wheat crop conditions.


## Running the Project

### Environment Setup

Ensure that you have the necessary dependencies installed. These typically include the C compiler and the stb_image library.

### Compilation 

Use the appropriate compiler command to compile the project.
For example: $ clang -o a main.c -lm
Replace main.c with the name of your C source file and a with the desired name for the compiled executable.
The -lm flag is used to link the math library, which might be necessary depending on the math functions used in your code. 
### Execution
Run the compiled executable:
$ ./a
